# Introduction
  This is a simple application built with JavaScript, Leaflet library and OpenStreetMap. It is used for tracking workouts like running and cycling. The user can input their data, which includes the type of workout, distance covered, duration, and additional information depending on the type of workout.

# File Structure

The code is written in a single file, script.js, which contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

# Code Overview
The code is divided into two main parts: the Workout class hierarchy and the application architecture.

## Workout Class Hierarchy

This section contains the code for the Workout class hierarchy. The hierarchy consists of two classes: Workout, Running, and Cycling.

    - Workout: This is the parent class for Running and Cycling. It contains common properties like date, ID, and clicks, and a common method _setDescription() which is called by its child classes. The _setDescription() method sets the description for each workout based on the date, month, and type of workout.

    - Running: This class extends the Workout class and adds the properties cadence and pace which are used to calculate the running pace. It also calls the _setDescription() method to set the workout description.

    - Cycling: This class extends the Workout class and adds the property elevationGain and the method calcSpeed() which is used to calculate the cycling speed. It also calls the _setDescription() method to set the workout description.

## Application Architecture

This section contains the code for the application architecture. It consists of the following parts:

     - App class: This is the main class for the application. It contains methods for getting the user's location, loading the map, displaying the form, and creating new workouts. It also has methods for rendering the workout list and the workout markers on the map. The App class initializes the event listeners for the form and the workout list.

     - form: This is the form element in the HTML. It is used to input the workout data.

     - containerWorkouts: This is the div element in the HTML where the workout list is displayed.

     - inputType, inputDistance, inputDuration, inputCadence, inputElevation: These are the input elements in the form used to input the workout data.

# Conclusion

In summary, the code is a simple application for tracking workouts. It consists of a Workout class hierarchy and an application architecture built with JavaScript, Leaflet library, and OpenStreetMap.
